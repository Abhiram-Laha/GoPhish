# 🕵️‍♂️ Phishing Simulation with GoPhish  

This project is a **safe phishing simulation** I created using [GoPhish](https://getgophish.com/).  
The goal was to understand how phishing works from an attacker’s perspective, but in a **controlled environment** with **test accounts only**.

## 📖 Project Overview  

Phishing is one of the most common cybersecurity threats. To learn how it works, I used GoPhish to:  
- 📧 Create a **fake job invitation email**  
- 🌐 Build a **custom landing page** simulating a login form  
- 🚀 Launch a campaign to send the email to a test account  
- 📊 Track **opens, clicks, and submissions** in real time  

This simulation helped me see **how phishing campaigns operate** and why **awareness is critical** in preventing them.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Install GoPhish**  
   - Download GoPhish from the official site  
   - Run the server and access the web dashboard  

2. **Create Components**  
   - Email template (fake job invitation)  
   - Landing page (login simulation)  
   - Sending profile & campaign setup  

3. **Run Simulation**  
   - Launch the campaign  
   - Monitor results (opens, clicks, data submissions)  

4. **Analyze Findings**  
   - Identify which elements make emails convincing  
   - Understand user behavior when interacting with phishing attempts

## 📝 Key Learnings  

- ⚠️ Phishing emails can be very convincing when designed well  
- 🛡️ Simulations are a **safe way to learn attacker tactics**  
- 📊 Tracking results provides insights into **user behavior**  
- 🔑 Awareness and caution are essential to defend against phishing

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  

This project is strictly for **educational purposes**.  
All tests were performed in a **controlled environment** using **my own test accounts only**.  
Never use GoPhish or similar tools against real users without proper authorization.
